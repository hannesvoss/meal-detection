# meal-detection
This repository contains the code of a university project that aims to detect unannounced meals in time series data of glucose and insulin deliveries.

The plan is to try several different machine learning based approaches and learn from the tasks.

## Basics
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Semi-supervised learning
4. Active learning
5. Reinforcement learning
